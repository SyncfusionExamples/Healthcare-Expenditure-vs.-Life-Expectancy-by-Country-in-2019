# Creating-a-Bubble-Chart-to-visualize-Healthcare-Spending-and-Life-Expectancy-by-countries
This article explains how to create the Bubble chart to visualize the Life Expectancy and Health Expenditure which adjusts differences between the countries.
## Bubble Chart
The bubble chart is represented by closely packed circles, whose areas are proportional to the quantities. To render a bubble chart, create an instance of [BubbleSeries](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.BubbleSeries.html?tabs=tabid-1%2Ctabid-28), and add it to the [Series](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfCartesianChart_Series) collection property of [SfCartesianChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html?tabs=tabid-1).

### Customizing the chart appearence
In this example, we have enhanced the appearence of our Bubble chart by customizing various elements, such as appearence of the axis elements, tooltip and title.
### Adding the Customized Title
A Title can improve the readability of the plotted data with a description in the chart.
### Axis Customization
We can customize axis elements, including the axis title, axis label style, line style and tick syle.

### Tooltip Customization
Using a tooltip, we can display the data in the data points. By including the Tooltiptemplate, we can display additional information about the datapoint.
